The objective of this work is to detect the appearance of the particle Z boson, determine its mass and reconstruct the parameters of its decay. This work consists of the following stages:
*  Problem describtion
*  Computing the invariant mass
*  Detecting the existance of Z boson
*  Using Bayesian optimization to determine the parameters of Z boson decay
